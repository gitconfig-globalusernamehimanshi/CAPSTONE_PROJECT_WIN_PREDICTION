# CAPSTONE_PROJECT_WIN_PREDICTION
I have done this capstone project  using Python and Tableau .
I have used Python for coding part and Tableau for trend graphs and bar plots .
In this project, we will analyze and predict the win possibilities 
of deals/projects for an IT consulting company and see how the 
possibility of winning a deal is impacted by other variables.
